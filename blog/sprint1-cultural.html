      <h1>identity and values exploration</h1>
      <h2>who am i</h2>
      <h3>twenty six june | twenty twenty</h3>
      <br>
      <p>I found it an interesting process reflecting on the question ‘Who am I?’, it is not something I have necessarily spent much time thinking about. This journey is ultimately why I ended up calling my blog ‘iam.’, because to me, I am who I am and this speaks louder than I can articulate. My identity is my actions and the words I speak, it is my children and the strong people they are growing up to be, it is the relationships I hold and the works I have accomplished. Who am I? I am.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I believe that your identity is continually shifting and evolving, usually not too far off your core centre, but you are being shaped by your experiences constantly. Sometimes it may be that your values and identity are not changing so much, but that their relative priorities are shifting. For a very long time, my identity was wrapped up in creativity and being a musician. I played in a serious band and after that was heavily involved in the writing, recording and playing of music for our church. At the moment however,  one of my biggest values and parts of my identity is family. Having kids completely changed my life and continues to shape my daily perspective. Why I do things, what I do, and how I do them. This has taken a priority position over my value in creativity and music. I went from playing guitar daily to not having picked up my guitar for about two years because life has just been too busy. Does this mean I do not value music? Am I no longer creative, a guitarist? Of course not. It is a season, and I look forward to picking the guitar back up, probably next year. </p>
      <br>
      <p>I took a values test online and the results were pretty accurate, with my core values being; family, creativity, freedom, happiness, integrity and excellence. I am a big believer that people should do what feels right for them and what makes them happy. If you are not being true to your self, then how can you truly be happy? I say this with a sly sense of ironic cynicism, because at my last job I was probably only truly fulfilling the last two, that is where Dev Academy comes in.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Managing my workload with my own limitations in mind will take a number of active strategies</p>
      <br>
      <p>As for how my culture has shaped my identity and values, being a NZ-European it is easy sometimes to feel like you don’t have much culture. The kiwi culture however has totally shaped my values and identity. We live on the coast (Whangaparaoa) and there is a real ‘old time kiwi’ feel up here. The pace is fairly slow, people are nice to each other, and everyone lives on the beach. It is very family oriented and a lovely place to raise kids. Growing up in a church environment has also had a big impact on my core values, outworking itself in always striving to be a genuinely good person and doing right by others.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Strengths is a different journey. I could immediately articulate my strengths, and that is because one of my greatest strengths is my own self belief or confidence. The cliched mindset of ‘you can do anything you put your mind to’ has been something I have always believed, and have rarely been proved wrong.</p>
      <br>
      <p>In order to get some perspective on my strengths however, I took the high5 test, which asks 100 questions and then highlights your five strongest strengths. The results were uncannily spot on.</p>
      <br>

          </div>
      <br>
      <p>I also sent the high5 test to a bunch of people to fill out for me, to see my internal view resonates with how others see me. I was happy to find basically the same set of strengths repeated, often just in a different order.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have always held that my two biggest strengths were my self belief/confidence, and my ability to adapt to any environment and succeed, and the tests showed exactly that. My background is event management, however I left that industry after about five years and took a very corporate job with a property developer that was far outside my comfort zone, I had to buy a suit just for the interview! I had to learn a completely new industry with a fair amount of complexity and jargon, but today I could happily discuss a set of architectural plans or consents with you. I believe these strengths will be immensely helpful in my new journey with Dev Academy, as though technology and computers are very familiar to me, coding is not.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When it comes to my limitations, with the benefit of age and experience, I think I am mostly aware of these. I know I need to work on my time management, procrastination and focus. My biggest struggle is that one my limitations is also my strength - my self belief and confidence. I have had instances where this confidence has been viewed as arrogance and has caused me trouble. I was mortified to learn that this was how I was received by some colleagues and have had to work on adjusting my approach depending on the situation and audience. An example of this is giving feedback or making suggestions for other people’s work, and making sure this is delivered respectfully and tactfully as not to offend or come off too strong, even though the intention is good. I also need to make sure this doesn’t rob me of problem solving outside the box because I am too confident I have the right path already.</p>
      <br>
      <p>All in all, I enjoyed this reflection. It helped affirm some of the decisions I have made lately and that they are in keeping with my core values and identity. As a last reflection I thought about how my twenty year old self would have filled this out and what he would have thought of what this old man would have wrote. I think he would have been happy with the path I am on, after all he did say at the height of rock and roll “I will never wear a suit and sit at a desk all day.”</p>
