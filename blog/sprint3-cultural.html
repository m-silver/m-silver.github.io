      <h1>emotional intelligence</h1>
      <h2>eq is the new iq</h2>
      <h3>ten july | twenty twenty</h3>
      <br>
      <p>This blog post we are going to look at emotional intelligence (EQ or EI), what it is, how it is different from IQ, and why it is important.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>What is EQ?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>EQ (emotional quotient) js our ability to perceive, process and regulate our emotions accurately and effectively. It is our ability to understand our emotions, <em>as well as</em> our ability to use this understanding. It is our rational brain processing and using information from our emotional brain.</p>
      <br>
      <p>EQ can be broken down into five key attributes or skills.</p>
      <ol>
          <li>Self awareness: our ability to recognise and understand ones own emotions and their impact on others. </li>
          <li>Self regulation: our ability to manages ones negative or disruptive emotions and to adapt to changes in circumstance.</li>
          <li>Motivation: our ability to self motivate with a focus on achieving internal or self gratification.</li>
          <li>Empathy: our ability to recognise and understand how others are feeling and consider those feelings before responding in social situations.</li>
          <li>Social skills: our ability to manage the emotions of others through emotional understanding and use this to build rapport and connect with people.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>All of the above skills fall into two categories, our personal competence (inward), and our social competence (outward).</p>
      <br>
      <h4>How does EQ differ from IQ?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>IQ (intelligence quotient) is the measure of one’s reasoning ability, that is their ability to use information and logic to solve problems or make predictions. Historically, a disproportionate amount of importance has been placed on IQ and its relationship to success.</p>
      <br>
      <p>While a person’s IQ is relatively fixed from adulthood onwards, a person’s EQ is a collection of skills that can be learned and developed. When these skills are practiced, the brain strengthens the neuron networks and pathways involved, strengthening these connections for future use.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A person’s EQ is completely discrete from their IQ, and even from their personality. One can have a high IQ and a low EQ or vice versa.    </p>
      <br>
      <p>EQ has a far wider scope of benefits and influence on a person’s life than their IQ, which mainly benefits situations dependent on raw intelligence such as academic research.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Why is EQ important?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Every stimulus we receive passes from the brain stem through the limbic system (a part of our brain responsible for emotions and memories), meaning we are forming emotional reactions to stimuli before processing them rationally. Because of this, it is imperative to understand our emotions, so that we can respond with intentionality, rather than react impulsively.    </p>
      <br>
      <p>EQ is the foundation for many of life’s critical skills, and establishing a solid foundation here will set you up for success in all aspects of your life</p>

      <br>
      <p>Recently, the workplace has begun to put a lot more emphasis on the importance of EQ with regards to hiring, promotions, leadership and success. However the benefits are for more important than just workplace success.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>The top 5 benefits to a high EQ</h4>
      <br>
      <ol>
          <li>Mental health - self awareness and self regulation can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, anger and more.</li>
          <li>Physical health - the above mental health benefits can carry over to physical health benefits, reduce the chance of hypertension, heart problems, diabetes and more.</li>
          <li>Relationships and communication - both the self competence and social competence skills will allow you to form stronger and more meaningful relationships, and mange relational conflict better.</li>
          <li>Success - EQ plays a meaningful role in academic and workplace success.</li>
          <li>Leadership - the best leaders all have a high EQ. It allows them to inspire and motivate, build trust and rapport with their team members, resolve conflict and adapt as necessary.</li>
      </ol>
      <br>
      <p>All of the above will make you more employable and see better work success, as well as penetrate every aspect of your life. That is why EQ is so important and worth putting in time and effort to develop.</p>
