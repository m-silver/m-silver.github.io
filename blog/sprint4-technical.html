        <br>

        <p>
            This week we worked on a number of ‘katas’, or coding challenges, it involved a lot of problem solving!
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One particular example was with the ‘Scooby Doo’ kata. A simple premise, find the door that Scooby Doo was
            hiding behind. In code, this looked like taking an array of objects, finding the object that had the
            property hiding: ‘Scooby’, and return the corresponding value of door. I spent a LONG time iterating through
            the array with a for loop, finding the object with hiding: ‘Scooby’, but could not figure out how to get the
            answer I needed to pass the tests. After getting to the end of my rope I reached out on Slack, and someone
            suggested using .find() instead of the for loop, and bam, I was solving the problem in no time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Reaching out to others for help provided a different view that I had not seen. No one told me the exact code
            to use or how to explicitly solve the problem, but their experience offered a perspective got me to look at
            the problem in a different way and led to my solving of it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            At my previous job I had to solve problems on a daily basis. One of my proudest achievements was related to
            our process of apartment upgrades and variations (colour of carpet, type of bench top, what appliances etc),
            which because of its manual nature, was time intensive and susceptible to human error. The solution to this
            problem was a bespoke app that automated the process with a beautiful UX experience for the customer, a win
            win. What I loved about this process was the problem was solved through collaborative creativity. Two of us
            dreamt a ‘what if’ before even thinking it was a possibility. An app that could walk the customer through
            the process with renders that would update in real time, that would be simple to use for the customer but in
            the back end would populate complex architectural documents to specify the selections to the consultants.
            After realising this was something worth pursuing here we looped in a few more team members to brainstorm on
            features and scope, worked with a web developer and designer to deliver, and a year later this dream was a
            reality. I could not have solved this problem on my own, and I think it is a great example of the power of
            collaboration. It was also the beginning of my current journey with web development.
        </p>

        <h4>Problem Solving Techniques</h4>
        <br>

        <h4>Psuedocode</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            This is definitely one of the problem solving techniques that I find very useful for solving code problems.
            It does two things for me. Firstly it breaks down the bigger problem into little bit sized problems. Solving
            the smaller problems is much easier than tackling the whole thing, which can be daunting enough to rob you
            of momentum. Secondly, as someone new to code, writing out the problem in layman is helpful for to properly
            understand what I am trying to achieve.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Trying Something</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            I think as I get more experience this will become something I do more often. In other areas of my life I
            like to give things a go and see how I get on, but with coding I do not have a broad enough understanding to
            try much! Not yet anyway…
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Rubber Ducky</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            I have been working in the library over the foundation sprints, and I am not sure the other patrons would be
            too fond of my talking to a rubber ducky (or myself) in such a quiet space… I do however believe that the
            technique and process can be effective. I had a problem where I reached out to my cohort on slack for help,
            almost immediately I realised where I had gone wrong! Perhaps I need to practice talking to the rubber ducky
            in my head, but I believe the technique is more effective when talking out loud.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Reading Error Messages</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of the most beautiful things about JavaScript is that the error messages mostly telly you EXACTLY where
            to look. They even point a little arrow to a certain character and say “Hey I wasn’t expecting this
            character?!”, so you have a pretty good idea where to look. I also find the failed test error messages
            helpful in diagnosing what I may be missing.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Console.logging</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Consol.log has been a great friend of mine. I mainly use it in two ways when trying to solve a code
            challenge. First I run a console.log on the arguments being passed into the function I am being tasked to
            write, which tells me exactly what I am being passed in the function, giving me a much better understanding
            of the challenge input and required output. Secondly I often console.log each step of the function as I
            write it, to check it is doing what I think it is. Paired with pseudocode, this helps me take a step by step
            walk through the challenge.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Googling</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            Well if console.log is a great friend, Google is my soul mate! It feels wrong to be googling the answers to
            everything, but boy oh boy are the answers out there. I find repeated comfort hearing and seeing my
            facilitator google how to do things during the workshop videos, because if can sure google the heck out of a
            problem.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Asking Peers</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            In the context of EDA asking my peers for help is extremely easy and extremely rewarding. Our cohort is a
            very friendly group with mixed levels of code understanding and experience. If you are having trouble with
            something, there is definitely someone who has already completed that part of the curriculum or who already
            knows the answer, and everyone is very quick and ready to help out. I am really looking forward to getting
            in a room with them all and completing pair and group work.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Asking Facilitators</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            I have absolutely loved my facilitator’s teaching style and approach. The workshop videos have been very
            clear and easy to learn from, and the few times I have reached out to him his answers have been extremely
            helpful. I hope to absorb as much gold from the facilitators at EDA as I can throughout the course.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Reflection</h4>
        <br>
        <p>
            This is probably the technique I feel least comfortable or confident in. I understand the benefits to
            journalling, it is just not a habit I have been able to form consistently.
