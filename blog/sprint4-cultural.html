        <!-- NEUROPLASTICITY SECTION -->

        <h4>Neuroplasticity</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Until recently, it was assumed that the brain became rather fixed or hard wired once someone reached
            adulthood. We grow up learning useful skills and information through childhood and adolescence. We go to
            school and possibly university to learn a profession, maybe we master a hobby along the way. Then we put a
            bow on it and call it our ‘fully formed brain’. Our personality has established itself, our natural giftings
            have become apparent, and we have equipped ourselves with a broad general knowledge and diversified in
            specialised areas. Sure, you can learn the odd new skill at work, or a new fact for the weekly pub quiz, but
            by and large your brain has stopped growing.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Wrong. It turns out you can teach an old dog new tricks (good news for the budding web developer doing a
            complete career 180!).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>This recent discovery has been coined ’neuroplasticity’, and states that our brains are not fixed, but are
            malleable like plastic.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            At a simple level, our brain is made up of a series of neural pathways and connections that are engaged when
            we think certain thoughts, perform certain actions, or recall certain memories. Scientists have discovered
            that the more you use these pathways, the stronger they get, and so too does the relevant action, thought or
            memory. We can think of this as similar to how Auckland Transport may add an extra lane to the motorway if
            the amount of cars using it exceeds the capacity, our brain senses the need strengthen a pathway that is
            commonly used so that it can fulfil that purpose better.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>How can understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefit people?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Understanding this concept suddenly opens the door to unending possibilities. Knowing that your brain has
            the capacity to learn, to grow, to stretch, and that none of this is inhibited by your natural born traits
            or your age? Knowing that if you practice, practice, practice something, that your brain is adding a lane to
            the motorway to take the additional traffic? Knowing these things could help you persevere with something
            that otherwise felt too hard or unnatural and strive for things you did not think were possible.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            As well as learning new skills, the concept of neuroplasticity can help people break bad habits and rewire
            their brain from things they do not want in their life. Habits, whether good or bad, are just strong neural
            pathways. They have been well travelled and so they fire easily. Just like repeated action or thought
            strengthens a neural pathway, not using that pathway causes it to weaken. Knowing that you are not a slave
            to something, and that you can rewire your brain with some hard work, can be a real beacon of hope to those
            that need it.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Everyday I engage with the EDA curriculum I am practising the principles of neuroplasticity. As someone
            going ‘back to school’ to retrain in a new field, the knowledge that I am capable of learning completely new
            skills is empowering. I am thankful that neuroplasticity was covered in the prep curriculum as it has
            already helped me persevere with grasping some tough concepts, and some moments where everything felt too
            hard to understand.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>What are some ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Practice, practice, practice. The more you do something, the stronger the neural pathways get. For me, I am
            learning so many new concepts and tools that the only way to keep them from floating away is to keep using
            them.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One really interesting thing that research has showed, is that just imagining an action can have a similar
            effect on the brain to actually performing the action. This means we can practice and strengthen our neural
            pathways by just imagining we are practising physical actions. I actually used to rehearse guitar this way
            while stuck in traffic, listening to songs and imagining playing the guitar parts, and it totally worked!
            When we begin bootcamp I will have a 1.5+ hour commute in, and plan on using this time to practice,
            practice, practice.

        <!-- GROWTH MINDSET SECTION -->

        <h4>Growth Mindset</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Growth mindset is really an extrapolation of neuroplasticity. It is adopting a mindset that acknowledges
            neuroplasticity and that learning is a process. If you believe this, and focus on and encourage the process
            and your particular part of the journey, then it is a matter of when not if.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Dr Carol Dweck challenges the fixed mindset, that people have fixed abilities or intelligence, and
            encourages an adoption of the growth mindset, that ability is developed and we are all on this journey of
            this development. Dweck argues that the mindset we adopt can shape the way we respond to many things,
            illustrated by the image below.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Did anything surprise you or change for you researching this?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            I am a big proponent of self-belief, and so the growth mindset did not surprise me but rather resonated with
            me. I did however find the results of some of the studies surprising in their magnitude. Ie a class of
            students going from the lowest performing class in the district to the top over a year of teaching growth
            mindset.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>How will I integrate growth mindset into my journey?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            When I am struggling, stumped, or ‘failing’, I will celebrate the process and say “not yet”. I will look for
            strategies to overcome and remind myself that solving problems is really the essence of programming, so
            solve some problems! I thought I might even change the formatting of my code tests to return ’not yet’
            rather than ‘failed’ just for kicks!
