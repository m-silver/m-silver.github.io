      <h4>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>For me, Covid 19 lockdown came with a lot of interesting revelations, yes some negative ones, but also some really positive ones. I had been commuting into the CBD for the last six years from Whangaparaoa, something that took between two - three hours of every week day. It is amazing how when you are used to something you don’t think about it, you just do it. Well during lockdown, of course I stopped doing it. All of a sudden I was having breakfast with my family, taking my eldest to pre-school, having lunch breaks with the family, having dinner with the family, doing bath and bed time with the kids. Pre-lockdown it would not be uncommon to leave while the kids were asleep, and come home when the kids were asleep. Well no longer! A week of going back to the commute grind was incredible painful, and now seemed so pointless. I was just as productive working from home (sometimes even more productive), yet had so much more work life balance. This is something I want to unlock for my future. To take control, and be able to work remotely, or with more flexible conditions. It is something I am doing for my family and for my well being. As for where exactly that may take me, I don’t think I will know 100% until going through the EDA course. I have a love for technology and an eye for design. I believe a natural career destination for me would be product management (having the overall vision for the app, how it looks, the user experience, and managing the team to deliver this), but I may love being behind the keyboard coding away. I am excited to see where I end up. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>As far as non technical skills, there are three areas I would love to focus on. Time management, focus and problem solving. The last one I am good at but always want to better, the first two I definitely need to work on!</p>
      <br>
      <h4>What are your strengths and limitations?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>As part of my value and identity exploration (which can be found in my sprint one core blog here), I identified my core strengths as self belief, adaptability, and problem solving. I also identified my limitations as time management, focus, and my confidence causing bullheadishness. </p>
      <br>
      <h4>Based on the above, how will you manage your workload in this programme?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Managing my workload with my own limitations in mind will take a number of active strategies</p>
      <br>
      <p>Time management - There are two key strategies I am employing to tackle time management. Firstly I need to stick to the suggested timeboxes, and use my own time boxes where necessary to ensure I do not fall behind. I also need to keep reminding myself of ‘just in time’ learning, as I have a tendency to get distracted learning things I don’t need at that time. As a side note, I am working approx half to a full day a week on emails for my prior job. I have found I need to set aside a specific time (say over lunch) to check and write these emails, and make sure I am not looking at them as they come in as they can be very distracting.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Focus - This kind of goes hand in hand with the above, but on top of this I will be keeping in mind breaking down big problems into smaller ones, and also trying not to force something that isn’t working. Ie if I am not being productive, try move to something else, or take a break and come back to it.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Confidence - When working with others I will make sure to be conscious of my approach, to listen, and to respond appropriately. I will try to see and value alternative perspectives for all problems.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>How and where will you seek help in a timely way?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>I have learned already that you can waste a lot of time banging your head against a brick wall. Luckily this industry and its community are very supportive and it doesn’t have to be that way. I have loved watching people ask for and receive help on slack, and I need to remember to do the same when I get stuck. I spent forever trying to wrap my head around flexbox (I competed the freecodecamp section three seperate times!). Eventually I reached out to my brother who is a developer, and a few simple comments helped make it click for me, why hadn’t I done that sooner! My commitment is to follow the following path to save spiralling - try to solve the problem, if I cannot, google a solution, if I still cannot, reach out for help on slack, if I STILL cannot, reach out to a facilitator.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>What do you expect from the facilitation team?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The EDA way is clearly different to university, and I personally think much better. My understanding (and experience so far) is that the facilitation team is there for you when you need them. They will deliver the content and all the learning tools to you for you to tackle at your own pace, and really leave you to it unless you need help. My expectation is that if I do need help that it is available to me.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Is there any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>The mornings and evenings are the busiest times for our household, getting the kids ready for pre-school, and dinner/bedtime. During foundations I am starting my study day at 9.30am and finishing around 4.30am so I can help out and make the most of being available. This means I do a little bit of work once the kids have gone to bed which isn’t so bad. When the bootcamp starts I will not have this luxury as it will be nine weeks of heavy commuting (ah flashbacks to CBD work life!), I will likely be gone 7am - 7pm is my guess.</p>
