      <h4>What is the difference between HTML, CSS and JS?</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Every website you see consists of HTML, CSS and probably JS. HTML and CSS are the building blocks of the web, and each are as fundamentally important as the other. We can think of HTML as the architect - they define the structure of a building, the layout, how many rooms and what is in those rooms. HTML similarly defines the content of a website. The text you read, the order you read it in, and any images or links that are displayed. CSS on the other hand the interior designer -  they define the colour of the paint on the walls, the type of carpet used, what material the vanity unit is made from, or how low the chandelier hangs. For a website, this is the font, the colour, the sizing, the margins, and so much more. Now Javascript is the really fun one of the group, they are the home automation expert. They make your home come alive and do exciting things like turn lights on when you come into a room or draw the blinds when the sun hits a certain lumen level. With regards to a website or application, JavaScript is responsible for the interactivity, actions that happen when you click, auto play of videos, animations and so much more.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Control flow and loops</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Control flow is the order in which code is executed. With some clever tools, this order can be manipulated and rearranged based on certain conditions.  To use a real world example, there is a basic order of events that occur whenever I get into the car with my family. First I put the baby in their car seat, do up the straps, check the straps, and adjust the mirror that lets me see them in the rear view. I then perform these same actions for the toddler, I help them get into their car seat, I do up the straps, check the straps, and adjust the mirror. I then get into the car myself, do my seatbelt, check my rearview mirror and am on my way. This order is the same every time I get in the car with my family, but how silly would I be if I still performed all of the same actions when I was alone? That would be madness! Instead when I am getting into the car by myself, I skip the two car seats and go straight to getting into the car, doing up my seatbelt etc. I control this flow of events with common sense, whereas with JavaScript we control this flow with if and if / else statements. If certain parameters are true, run this code, or else if other parameters are true, run that code.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Loops are another element of control flow, in that they tell a piece of code to run until a certain parameter is met. If we continue with the above analogy, there are certain things we know to do when we want to turn left from a stop sign. We stop, we look right for oncoming traffic, and we continue looking right until there is no oncoming traffic, then we pull out. We run the action until the parameter is met, then we move onto the next action. If we wanted to turn right, then the analogy amalgamates both conditional logic and loops! First we look left, and we continue looking left until there is no incoming traffic, then we look right , and if there is no incoming traffic we pull out, else we continue looking right until there is no incoming traffic, then we look left again, and if there is no incoming traffic we pull out, else we continue looking left until there is no incoming traffic…. And repeat!</p>

      <h4>The DOM</h4>
      <br>
      <p>No not a 50 Shades of Grey character, rather the Document Object Model. The DOM is a replica version of a websites HTML but with the code represented by objects. This allows the JavaScript to interact with and even change the HTML, allowing scripts to perform some really exciting tasks such as changing or adding classes, making things appear or disappear, or literally changing the content within the HTML.</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Arrays and objects</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Arrays and objects are two ways in JavaScript to group a list or set of values. Arrays are a list of values that are accessed by their numerical position (index), whilst objects are a collection of properties that are accessed by their name. Let’s use a shopping list as an example.</p>
      <br>
      <p>You have a shopping list that consist of milk, coffee and sugar. On the way to the supermarket, your wife calls to tell you that you actually already have coffee, and it is tea you need instead. If this list was an array, you would need to access and change the second item on your list by using its index number of one (shoppinglist[1]). That’s not too hard to do, you only have three items on your list, and you know that coffee is the second. But what if this was your weekly shop and coffee was the 27th item on a list of 63 items? Would you remember its index of [26]? If your shopping list was an object however, you could access and update the hot drink needed by name (shoppinglist[‘hot drink’] = tea).</p>
      <br>
      <h4>Functions</h4>
      <br>
      <p>Functions are a set of code that can be executed at any time. They are an incredibly useful tool that can create cleaner and more efficient code by creating repeatable sets of code for performing specific tasks. This is useful as it condenses the amount of code, making it more readable, more efficient, with less chance of error and easier to test when there are errors. The less code that can perform the same task the better!</p>
