        <h4>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            In the last five weeks I have learned a lot about myself.<br>
            <ol>
                <li>I often have trouble focusing and staying on task. But as it turns out, it is a lot easier to stay focused when the task at hand is something you are interested in. I believe a lot of my focus issues at work have been related to being unengaged, rather than innate attention issues. This coupled with some of the helpful focus techniques, (breaking the problem into small chunks, taking breaks, pomodoro, etc) has really helped for my focus.</li>
                <br>
                <li>How much of an active task proper listening can be! I was surprised at the amount of attention it took to fully listen and loop back. I also found myself desperately wanting to insert my opinion or proposed solutions into my loop back, and I learned that this was probably something I needed to work on.</li>
                <br>
                <li>That I do not feel any less when I ask for help. It has been a humbling experience ‘starting again’ in a field that is completely new to me. I am a confident person and my default position is to figure things out for myself, sometimes banging my head against a brick wall until I can brute force my way through. I have learned through foundations that asking for help is a much more efficient way forward, and that the result is just as good or better than if I had slogged on. I have also learned that this process is beneficial to everyone involved, and that the teacher better cements their own understanding, or may even learn something new through the process themselves.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h4>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            I believe our values, empathy and self awareness are important in everything we do. Together they form the guidebook for how to navigate this life with respect for yourself and for others. With regards to learning and programming, self awareness and empathy are foundational in setting yourself up to work well other people. Recognising our own strengths, weaknesses and emotions grounds our understanding of our self, and means we know the ‘me’ we are putting forward. Having empathy allows us to connect this to someone else strengths, weaknesses and emotions and find harmonious productivity and creativity.  
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
            Our values are particularly important as we embark on a new programming career,. They should direct us in what we want to do with this training, where we want to end up, the culture we want to be part of or form, whether we want to start our own business or find one that matches our ideals, what we do and what we don’t want to create.
        </p>

        <h4>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            The most surprising thing about the core curriculum is that it exists in the first place. If these things were taught through school and university we might see a very different generation emerge. I think the core curriculum is a real point of difference for EDA and one of the reasons it is so highly recommended.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Writing these posts! I am not much of a writer, and have not really dabbled in reflection or journalling before. Sometimes it can be hard to get started and put pen to page (or finger to key). I do see however how it can be an effective learning process
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h4>
        <br>
        
        <p>
            Core skills are imperative in gaining employment and succeeding in the tech industry (or most industries for that matter). Employers view hard skills as relatively teachable (for example if you have not used a particular library or language before), but soft skills as relatively fixed (a bad team player will always be a bad team player). The core skills are also beneficial and applicable in all areas of your life, which is just an added benefit for a programming course!
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Definitely not, that would be a shortsighted view on the matter. Yes I could have learned a bit more about programming over the last five weeks, but the time spent on core makes the tech learning more efficient and effective. I cannot prove the theory, but I believe if you ran a group through the course as is and compared them with a group that ran a version where time was spent 100% on tech with no core, then the first group would not only come out more rounded with their core skills, but would have achieved better in the tech content as well.

        <h2>Learning Reflection Part 2</h2>
        <br>

        <h4>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            I don’t have the exact destination in mind for when I leave Dev Academy, this is formulating as I progress through the course. I know I am really enjoying the curriculum and the environment and I am excited about launching a career in this industry. I do know that one of the impacts I would like to make is on my family and on my sense of self. One of the driving factors of going through Dev Academy was to take back control of my work life and find something that can provide a more flexible working environment and also be something that I find interesting and can feel proud of.

        <h4>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            I believe my strengths and limitations from Sprint 2 still hold as fairly accurate. I would add to these being conscious of active listening 
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            There are a number of non-technical challenges I am aware of. The biggest for me will most likely be balancing time with my family through this intense period. I will be back to having an extremely long commute, and on top of that will have work to complete in the evenings/weekends. I will take comfort knowing that this is just for a time, and keep the end goal in front of me.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            I would like to further develop my leadership skills and teamwork skills. I have worked in plenty of teams and have had managerial roles with team members under me, but I think these skills could be improved, they can always be improved!
        </p>
        <br>

        <h4>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h4>
        <br>

        <p>
            Having been through foundations, and learning how much simply asking for help from fellow cohort members can propel you passed your problems or blockages, I endeavour to ask for help earlier than my natural tendencies dictate. To help manage my workload, I am going to stay behind for an hour-ish each day (also to let the traffic die down), and two days a week I will dedicate to staying later or working later. I will give myself breaks and rewards, and celebrate the learning process and the journey I am on, even when it is difficult.
